# 🍜 NoodleCV

Multiplatform desktop application for image processing. 
Project is inspired by Blender, Unreal Engine, Substance Designer and other node-based editors.

User will be able to add blocks representing operations and pass the inputs with connections creating series of
functions like you could do in code but with no programming knowledge required.

Software should be good enough for demonstrating quick prototypes of image processing workflows. 
Ideally preview should update on user input for quick feedback.

First priority is getting simple functions like blur to work. 
Types of data other than images are planned for future developement.

# 🚀 Running the app

For now there isn't much to run. 
Soon I will provide methods for publishing dotnet project and also setup automatic releases.

# 🧰 Stack

Application is developed in C# with AvaloniaUI targeting desktop platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS).
Operations will be implemented from OpenCV.
